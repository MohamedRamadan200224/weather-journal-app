# Weather-Journal App Project

The project intends to help the people know the temperature of the place with the zipcode they wrote by **async** javascript.

This async js is made with the help of the starter code containing html and css given by **udacity**.

It aims to get the temperature data in the client side from **the external api** of **openweathermap.com** then sending it to the server side in the object **projectData**.

The next step is to send this object to the client side so that it can appear to the user after pressing the button.

All of this is made by async javascript functions such as: fetch() .
